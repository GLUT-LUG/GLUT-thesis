    Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation(NLSE) is not only an important problem in nonlinear fiber optics, but also one of the important topics in nonlinear partial differential equations. The Inverse Scattering Transform Method(IST) can be used to get the analytical solution of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation In mathematics, but it needs to solve a very complex integral equation. So it is necessary to solve nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation numerically. There is a special kind of solution in nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. During the transmission process, the optical pulse will undergo a periodic evolution process of narrowing, splitting, and recovery. It is an optical soliton, which is the result of the combined action of dispersion and nonlinear effects. In this paper, pseudospectral method, split-step Fourier method(SSFM) and finite difference method are used to solve the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation numerically, and the physical picture of the periodic evolution of single optical soliton is obtained.
